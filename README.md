# remindeer
A command-line-based time reminder. 
The user inputs the work and rest time they might require and the script reminds them once the defined time comes. 
This script runs using the `win10toast` library which is only available via Windows and in order for it to run correctly it should be installed.

Win10toast installation:
  `pip install win10toast`
